Crystal Collector Game

This project is an attempt to create a game that:

1. Makes the computer generate a random number from 19-120

2. Makes the computer generate a random number from 1-12, one each, for 4 seperate crystal icon buttons

3. Asks the player to click on the 4 different crystal buttons in no given order to attemp to create a number that adds up and equals to the first randomly generated number

4. Be able to reset itself and start a new game after the user either succeeds in matching the randomly generated number or fails to do so

The purpose of the project is to practice implementation of jQuery to create a functional game.

The game starts as soon as it is loaded in the browser.

Project is maintained by me (Xiao aka MagiSeaCow).
